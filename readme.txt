== Description ==

With its clean, minimal design and powerful feature set, FlexLine enables agencies to build stylish and sophisticated WordPress websites. FlexLine is a masterpiece of design and functionality. It features a range of valuable patterns, including hero and portfolio sections, prominent call-to-action buttons, and customer testimonials. Whether you’re building a website for your business, personal brand, or creative project, FlexLine is perfect for anyone looking to launch quickly and efficiently.


== Installation Notes ==

For additional helper features, install the optional **FlexLine Utilities Plugin**. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/wpengine/flexline/releases/latest/download/flexline-utilities.zip and provides shortcodes like `[flexline_year]` for the current year or `[flexline_loginout]` to output login and logout links.

== Plugin Integrations ==

FlexLine includes opinionated styling for a few popular plugins so their front-end output matches the theme out of the box.

* Gravity Forms – form fields, buttons, and validation notices inherit FlexLine typography, spacing, and color treatments.
* Events Manager – event lists, single templates, and the bundled starter settings blend with the theme’s layout system.
* Query Loop Filters – filter bars and controls from Human Made’s Query Loop Filters plugin adopt FlexLine’s navigation spacing and button styling.
* Yoast SEO – install to use patterns that include the Yoast Breadcrumbs block; the theme doesn’t bundle alternative breadcrumb markup.

== WordPress 6.9 Accordion Block ==

WordPress 6.9 introduces the core Accordion, Accordion Item, Accordion Heading, and Accordion Panel blocks. FlexLine extends each of them with the theme’s visibility toggles plus style variations such as Card, Card w/ Padding, Outline, Glass, and Glass Card so editors can keep a consistent look without relying on any third-party accordion plugin.
