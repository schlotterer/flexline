== Description ==

With its clean, minimal design and powerful feature set, FlexLine enables agencies to build stylish and sophisticated WordPress websites. FlexLine is a masterpiece of design and functionality. It features a range of valuable patterns, including hero and portfolio sections, prominent call-to-action buttons, and customer testimonials. Whether youâ€™re building a website for your business, personal brand, or creative project, FlexLine is perfect for anyone looking to launch quickly and efficiently.


== Installation Notes ==

For additional helper features, install the optional **FlexLine Utilities Plugin**. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/wpengine/flexline/releases/latest/download/flexline-utilities.zip and provides shortcodes like `[flexline_year]` for the current year or `[flexline_loginout]` to output login and logout links.

== Horizontal Scroller Fade Transition ==

The horizontal scroller supports a **Fade** transition that cross-fades items instead of sliding.

* Set a custom container height.
* Choose how media is displayed: Normal (no extra class), Cover (`horizontal-fader-media-cover`) or Contain (`horizontal-fader-media-contain`).
* Enable autoplay with optional pause-on-hover or hidden pause button.

=== Columns example ===

```
<!-- wp:columns {"className":"is-style-horizontal-scroll horizontal-scroller-transition-fade","enableHorizontalScroller":true,"transitionType":"fade","fadeHeight":"300px","fadeMediaDisplay":"cover","scrollAuto":true} -->
    <!-- wp:column --><!-- /wp:column -->
    <!-- wp:column --><!-- /wp:column -->
<!-- /wp:columns -->
```

=== Post Template example ===

```
<!-- wp:post-template {"className":"is-style-horizontal-scroll horizontal-scroller-transition-fade","enableHorizontalScroller":true,"transitionType":"fade","fadeHeight":"300px","fadeMediaDisplay":"cover","scrollAuto":true} /-->
```

`horizontal-scroller-transition-fade` is required for the fade effect. The default `fadeMediaDisplay` of `"normal"` adds no class. Setting `fadeMediaDisplay` to `"cover"` adds the `horizontal-fader-media-cover` class and `"contain"` adds `horizontal-fader-media-contain`.
