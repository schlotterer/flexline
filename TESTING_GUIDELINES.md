# Testing Guidelines for FlexLine Theme

## Introduction
Thank you for contributing to the FlexLine theme! These testing guidelines are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency across the theme. Adherence to these guidelines helps maintain a robust and reliable product.

## Types of Testing

### Visual Regression Testing
- **Purpose**: To detect unintended visual changes introduced in new updates.
- **Tools**: Use tools like BackstopJS or Percy to automate visual regression testing.
- **Process**:
  - **Utilize Theme Patterns**: The theme includes a variety of sample and testing patterns specifically designed for visual testing. Leverage these patterns as part of your regression tests to ensure that visual consistency is maintained across updates.
  - **Capture Baseline Screenshots**: Take baseline screenshots of key pages and components using the included patterns. These serve as references for future tests.
  - **Compare Screenshots After Changes**: Automatically compare new screenshots to the baseline after implementing changes to detect any visual regressions.

### Other Testing Types
